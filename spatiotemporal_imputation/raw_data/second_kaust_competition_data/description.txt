The enclosed datasets have been generated by the internal spatial data generator tool included in the ExaGeoStat software (https://github.com/ecrc/exageostat). It was used for the 2022 KAUST Competition on Spatial Statistics for Large Datasets (https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/stsds/2022-kaust-competition-spatial-statistics-large-datasets). The competition had six parts (Sub-competition 1a, Sub-competition 1b, Sub-competition 2a, Sub-competition 2b, Sub-competition 3a, and Sub-competition 3b). The main purpose of the competition was to reassess existing approximation methods on large spatial datasets in a uniform way that guarantees a fair comparison. More information about the datasets can be found in the manuscript "The Second Competition on Spatial Statistics For Large Datasets"
